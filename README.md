# Robotic-path-planning
“Framework for testing multi-robot path planning algorithms with modular environment, planners, metrics, and visualization for efficiency, safety, coordination.”

## Problem Statement  

Modern industrial facilities rely on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for material transport, assembly support, and logistics operations. However, traditional approaches face several key challenges:  

1. **Minimizing Travel Time & Path Length**  
   - Efficient navigation requires optimized routes to reduce material transport delays and energy consumption.  

2. **Collision-Free Navigation in Dynamic Environments**  
   - Robots must adapt to **unpredictable obstacles**, moving machinery, and human workers while maintaining safe trajectories.  

3. **Task Allocation & Multi-Robot Coordination**  
   - Optimal task distribution and cooperation among multiple robots is critical to **maximize system throughput** and minimize idle time.  

This project aims to address these challenges through **AI-driven algorithms** integrating path planning, perception, and coordination into a unified framework.
